# Brahmaand - APOD Viewer

iOS app to browse [APODs](https://apod.nasa.gov/). There are already dozens of similar apps in the App Store, but none that I tried provided support for browsing APODs with left/right swipes. This one does. As a bonus, it also allows you to mark APODs as favorites, which are displayed separately from daily APODs.

## TODO
- Widget for today's APOD
- Better transition animations when switching between screens
- Background fetch of today's APOD every 24 hours
